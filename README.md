## Updates

Last Update:  02/10/20

What was Updated: Finalized most of the styling and card effects.  The game still ENDS on the first click after every page reload, but works outside of that.  I think the shuffle mechanic can be fixed to randomize better.

## Assignment Details

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Submission on BCS
### Instructions

1. Check out the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.

2. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

4. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.

## Problems

The major problem I had with this assignment was getting the cards to appear properly.  Currently, the only MAJOR issue with this game is that it automatically gives the user a GAME OVER on the very first Click of any card.  This occurs one time, on the first click, whenever there is a page reload. The only other issue I had, was I botched my first deploy attempt from [this repo](https://github.com/cerpinconsafo/Clicky-App/settings). I selected an incorrect option, and was unsure how to roll back the changes, so I made this repo (that is sadly lacking all of those commits).
